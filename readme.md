# Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Bot?

This repository contains my solution to the Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Bot? competition hosted on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot).

## Overview

Ever wonder what it's like to work at Facebook? Facebook and Kaggle launched an Engineering competition in 2015. The objective was to identify online auction bids placed by "robots" on an online auction site. The site's owners aimed to eliminate computer-generated bidding to prevent unfair auction activity and rebuild customer happiness.

## Task

The goal of the competition was to develop a model that could accurately identify bids placed by "robots" using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time. Submissions were evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve.

## Dataset

The data provided for the competition came from an online platform, not directly from Facebook. Each row in the dataset represented a bid, and the task was to predict the probability that a bidder was a robot. The competition strictly required using only the provided data for making predictions.
